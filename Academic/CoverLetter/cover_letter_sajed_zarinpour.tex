%
%I am writing to express my interest in the Doctoral Researcher position for Project B7, "Dynamics of electrical depolarization waves in the heart," at CRC 1173. I hold a Master's degree in Numerical Analysis from the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS), Iran, where my research focused on combining machine learning models with traditional numerical methods to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). I am particularly excited about the opportunity to apply my expertise in numerical modeling and programming to the interdisciplinary challenges of simulating heart function.
%
%During my Master's program, I worked on improving simulations of breast deformation under compression to better model realistic boundary conditions. To achieve this, I developed a custom periodic padding layer for TensorFlow/Keras, enabling efficient handling of domain uncertainty in PDEs. This experience not only deepened my understanding of numerical methods but also honed my programming skills and ability to solve complex problems creatively. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in numerical analysis, finite element methods, and computational modeling, which I believe are directly applicable to the challenges of modeling depolarization waves coupled with heart muscle contraction.
%
%Beyond my academic work, my experience as a software developer has strengthened my teamwork, problem-solving, and time management skills. For instance, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to deliver a project under tight deadlines, which required clear communication and adaptability. These experiences have prepared me to work effectively both independently and within an international research team.
%
%I am particularly drawn to this position because of its focus on the intersection of mathematics, biomedical engineering, and computation. The opportunity to contribute to the modeling and numerical simulation of cardiac dynamics within the interdisciplinary environment at KIT aligns perfectly with my long-term goal of conducting impactful research at the interface of mathematics and healthcare.
%
%With my background in numerical analysis, programming expertise, and passion for applying mathematics to biological systems, I am confident that I can make valuable contributions to Project B7. I am eager to bring my skills to your team, learn from the cutting-edge work at CRC 1173, and grow as a researcher in this exciting field.
%
%Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your research group and would be delighted to discuss my application further.

%%% who am I? why am I interested in this position?
%%I am Sajed Zarinpour. With this letter, I want to express my interest in the PhD vacancy entitled
%%‘Doctoral Researcher (f/div/m) in Computational Biology ’ in the research group Applied Systems
%%Biology at the Leibniz-HKI. I believe that my skills and experience are fit for this position. As I
%%am interested in the research topic and my background fulfils the required profile, I want to use
%%this excellent opportunity to pursue my research career. I would appreciate it if you would consider
%%my application.
%%
%%% What is my degree? what did I gained from it? what were my achievement? pave the way for works
%%I have completed my master degree in numerical analysis at the Institute for Advanced Studies in
%%Basic Sciences (IASBS), Iran. During this program, I studied machine learning models alongside
%%traditional methods of solving partial differential equations. I chose the subject because I wanted
%%to use neural networks to improve simulations of breast deformation under compression. One of
%%the challenges was to extend the uncertainty of the domain periodically, replicating the periodic
%%boundary condition of the PDE. However, there was no periodic padding layer in TensorFlow Keras,
%%so I had to extend the library with a costume layer. The initial idea was to tiling the input and
%%then trimming it to the desired size. The final implementation has done more efficient by sampling
%%and joining segments of input in a particular order.
%%
%%% A short justification of what is my take from my working experience which can contribute to be better fit, for example my experience with design pattern, clean code and package developement
%%Because of my experiences in my part-time job as a software developer, I am very good at team-
%%work and individual working under deadlines. Moreover, I am a good problem solver; I can simplify
%%complex problems, use different strategies, assess the limitations and act accordingly.
%%I like using frontiers of mathematics and computer science in health care. I can refer to the project
%%of my master that initially was for computing breast deformation and my studies on an advanced
%%mathematical model about heterogeneous melanoma as examples. And of course, I appreciate the
%%modern and interdisciplinary environment of the Jena School of Microbial Communication.
%%To sum up, given my mathematical insight and computer science background and enthusiasm about
%%biology, I believe I am an ideal candidate for this PhD program. I am eager and able to learn any
%%required programming languages and courses. I want to develop myself in my PhD and later to bea professor engaged in research.
%%
%%%why am I interested in the subject, group and a bit personal connection to the position.
%%% wrapp it up
%%Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope that this letter has given you some insight into
%%my dedication to my learning and that you will consider my application favourable. I am eager to
%%receive your feedback.

		I am writing to express my strong interest in the Doctoral Researcher position for Project B7, "Dynamics of electrical depolarization waves in the heart," at CRC 1173. With a Master's degree in Numerical Analysis from the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS), Iran, I have developed a strong foundation in combining machine learning methodologies with traditional numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).  The opportunity to contribute my expertise in numerical modeling and programming to the interdisciplinary challenges of simulating heart function within Project B7 is particularly compelling to me.
		
%		During my Master's program, my research was initially motivated by the challenges of biophysical modeling, specifically in simulating breast deformation under compression. While my thesis ultimately focused on the mathematical methodology – developing a novel neural network approach to solve PDEs with uncertainties – this initial project, along with explorations into melanoma cancer and cellular growth modeling, ignited my passion for applying numerical techniques to biological systems. This experience provided me not only with a deepened understanding of numerical methods, finite element methods, and computational modeling, directly applicable to the complexities of depolarization waves and heart muscle contraction, but also honed my programming skills and creative problem-solving abilities, exemplified by the development of a custom periodic padding layer for TensorFlow/Keras to efficiently handle domain uncertainty in PDEs.  Furthermore, presenting my research findings in English at the IASBS Student Presentations in English further solidified my communication skills in an academic setting.
